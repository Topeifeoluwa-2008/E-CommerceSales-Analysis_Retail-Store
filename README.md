### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves the exploring of the Data to answer some question about the Data such as;
What is the overall sales trend
Which product are top sellers
What are the Products on peak sales?

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis;

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

```SQL
SELECT*FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```


### Data Visualisation



Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
